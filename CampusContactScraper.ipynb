Once it receives permission to access the website (status code 200), it starts examining the website's structure to find the information it needs.\n",

The script carefully searches through these pieces, known as HTML elements, to find the ones that hold the names, locations, and contact numbers of the campuses. It's like sifting through a stack of papers to find specific bits of information.\n",

This part involves looking for a specific section on the webpage where the phone numbers are kept, a bit like finding a phonebook within a library. Once it locates this section, it uses a special technique called regular expressions to identify and extract the phone numbers, making sure to account for different formats they might appear in.\n",

    "Once it's finished its investigation, the script checks to see if it managed to gather any contact information. If it did, it presents the findings in an easy-to-read format, almost like laying out a map with clear directions. For each campus it discovered, it lists out the name, location, and contact numbers so that anyone looking for this information can easily find it.\n",

    "In essence, this script acts as a helpful assistant, taking on the tedious task of collecting campus contact details from the NU website and presenting them in a user-friendly way. It's like having a reliable friend who knows just where to look for the information you need, saving you time and effort."
